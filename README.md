# Ember-CLI v4.4.0 + Rest API + Bootstrap 5

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

> The application uses `ember-data`, and `REST API`
> This application is created using the [Ember-CLI Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljLxZw-XStw)
> For this project, a JSON database provided by [Typicode](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) is used, with two types of interpolating data: [Users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users), and [Posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
* [Ember CLI](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/)
* [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/)

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd blog-ember-rest`
* `npm install`

## Improvements

* I changed the software version to `ember-cli 4.4.0`, on `node 14.17.0`
* I changed styling to SCSS, by installing `ember-cli-sass` which also installs `node-sass`
* I added Bootstrap 5 as CSS Framework, and configured the app to use it
* I added more fields for user, i.e. `address`, and `company`
